#### What is this project about
This repository is the final product of assignment 1, requested by the course MSB1015 (Scientific Programming). The goal is to create a repository which contains all information, documentation and files needed to run a wikidata query using html/javascript as a new user.


#### Project structure
### Where does data come from?
The query asks information from [Wikidata](http://wikidata.org) in a similar fasion the dedicated [Wikidata database query](https://query.wikidata.org/) works using the SPARQL language. Data on wikidata is published under the [Creative Commons Zero](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0) licence, stating 'others may freely build upon, enhance and reuse the works for any purposes without restriction under copyright or database law'.

### How is data shared, in what format, with what protocols?
Using the tool developed in this project, data is shared using the wikidata-sdk. The resulted format is [JSON](https://www.json.org/)

### How is data processed and analyzed?
The resulted JSON output can be saved to be further processed if needed.

### In what order do the processing and analysis steps take place?
Query -> JSON output -> external processing.
